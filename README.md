This repository contains my own implementation of several classic systems programming technologies.

Currently we have:

1. `bthreads` -- a recreation of pthreads with the `clone` syscall and x86 `lock` instructions.
2. `btar` -- a tar clone with random access to files
3. `bperf` -- an interrupt based profiler

In the works are:

1. `bgrep` -- a grep clone with NFA creation
2. `bjson` -- a basic C JSON parser
