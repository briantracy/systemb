This repository contains my own implementation of several classic systems programming technologies.

Currently we have:

1. `bthreads` -- a recreation of pthreads with the `clone` syscall and x86 `lock` instructions.

In the works are:

1. `bperf` -- a basic C profiler
2. `bjson` -- a basic C JSON parser
